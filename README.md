Fox Linux
----------

    This is my first Arch Linux configuration for i3! I've done tweaking of this config over a few months or so.
I'm quite new to not only GitHub and Arch Linux, but configuring too! I've moved from Windows 10 to Arch Linux a few months ago,
and the journey has been quite fun and refreshing! I feel using this knowledge I've learned from here, that I could begin work
on more pleasing configurations. I felt that I should archive these few configuration files before I get to work on more projects.
